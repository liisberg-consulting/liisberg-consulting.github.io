{"name":"The Liisberg Consulting Development Process Description","tagline":"","body":"Philosophy\r\n==========\r\n\r\n### We work asynchronously\r\n\r\n* We work anytime from anywhere\r\n* We don't have meetings\r\n* We don't have deadlines\r\n\r\nTo enable this, we communicate using three different channels:\r\n\r\n* chatroom where conversations is logged\r\n* scrumboard where work items (stories) is defined and the development track is laid out\r\n* pull requests (see \"Branches and pull requests\" below) where specific solutions is being discussed and worked on\r\n\r\nThis way, \r\n\r\n* no-one needs to be online at a specific time\r\n* you can ignore pings and turn to the pinger later, staying in \"the zone\" if you happen to be there\r\n\r\nThe Scrum Board\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThe scrum board is the center of the development process. Every feature, chore and bug lives here as stories. This means that **If it's not on the scrum board, it does not exist.**\r\n\r\nWe use pivotal tracker for scrum board (http://www.pivotaltracker.com). As a customer, you will be invited to participate actively with defining stories, prioritizing them and accepting them when they are done. We are perfectly fine with defining stories ourselves, but the quality and effectivity of the process will improve if you, the customer, understands how you can participate to increase throughput and assure the correctness of stories.\r\n\r\n### Different roles, different tasks, different responsibilities\r\n\r\nEvery project is unique and requires unique care. But there are a few guidelines customers can follow to make sure the development process is optimal. Here's the roles we usually meet:\r\n\r\n* End user representative\r\n* End customer representative (when we are a subcontractor)\r\n* Customer responsible\r\n* Customer developer\r\n* Lead (Liisberg Consulting project lead)\r\n* Developer (Liisberg Consulting developer)\r\n\r\n*End users* and *end customers* will sometimes want insight and influence into the work we do. This can be provided as a view-only access to the scrum board. It's only very seldom we allow anyone but the customer and internal developers access to define, prioritize and work with the stories in pivotal (but it does happen).\r\n\r\n*The customer* on the other hand, is invited to participate, but is asked to pay attention to a few ironclad rules:\r\n\r\n* You can define stories, but you need to always comply to the \"As a ..., I should be able to ...\" description style.\r\n* You can prioritize stories (by dragging them to the backlog/current), but you must accept that sometimes developers need to prioritize dependencies first to be able to start your story.\r\n* You CANNOT assign a specific developer og start a story. This is done by the developers themselves.\r\n* You MUST rush to test and accept stories when they are delivered. Unless we agree on a different process, it is the responsibility of the customer to accept stories that are delivered. By the way, in most cases 'delivered' means that it is already released to the public, so it should be in your best interest to discover any bugs or similar.\r\n\r\n*The lead* and *developers* participate in the entire life-cycle. They may break down a big story to several smaller ones to better estimate the work that needs to be done. They may organize stories in epics and tag them. They may add stories, re-prioritize due to dependencies, start, finish and deliver stories.\r\n\r\n### The life-cycle of a User Story\r\n\r\nHere's a quick sketch of how the life-cycle of a story looks:\r\n![Story life-cycle](http://content.screencast.com/users/jeppeliisberg/folders/Jing/media/f342f0c3-afb3-44e7-8760-4d4543af7228/00000226.png)\r\n\r\nTBD: improve and explain the story life cycle.\r\n\r\n### A note on discussions and team communications\r\n\r\nMany people use e-mail as the primary way of communication. But e-mail is bad. Way too often, threads are broken, the body drifts from the subject (if a proper subject was there from the start) and either too many or too few are in on the 'cc' list.\r\n\r\nWe prefer chat over e-mail. Our chat is used for short-lived discussions that lead to decisions and actions. Decisions is then documented elsewhere (eg. on the scrum board) and actions are taken by the relevant people. There's really not much more to it. Our developers should always be addressed via chat, not by e-mail.\r\n\r\nDiscussions that are related to a specific story, bug or chore (task), should always be documented in the relevant story on the scrum board. Either by having that conversation right there in the story, or by copying or writing down any relevant information from the chat (or even e-mail) into the story. Having all relevant information regarding a specific story in the story itself is crucial for the ability of developers to focus and efficiently deliver the right product!\r\n\r\nDevelopers manual\r\n=================\r\n\r\nIf you are not a developer, do not read further.\r\n\r\nThey way we work at Liisberg Consulting is heavily inspired from [The way the github team works](http://zachholman.com/talk/how-github-uses-github-to-build-github).\r\n\r\nCommit guidelines\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n### Rules of engagement\r\n\r\n1. commit every single change separately\r\n2. always start a commit message with a short (50 chars or less) summary\r\n3. remember ticket/story reference (see [Pivotal guide](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/api#scm_post_commit))\r\n4. never use `git commit -m` - think it through and read it again before you commit\r\n\r\n### Example commit message\r\n\r\n    Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary\r\n    \r\n    More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72\r\n    characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the\r\n    subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank\r\n    line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit\r\n    the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the\r\n    two together.\r\n    \r\n    Write your commit message in the present tense: \"Fix bug\" and not \"Fixed\r\n    bug.\"  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by\r\n    commands like git merge and git revert.\r\n    \r\n    Further paragraphs come after blank lines.\r\n    \r\n    - Bullet points are okay, too\r\n    \r\n    - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a\r\n      single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here\r\n    \r\n    - Use a hanging indent\r\n    \r\n    [Completes #12345]\r\n\r\n<cite>From [A Note About Git Commit Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)</cite>\r\n\r\nNOTE: The last line is the pivotal integration to link your commit to a related story.\r\n\r\n### Some background/philosophy\r\n\r\n> *Commit messages are important.* They document the project’s progress and they’re a great way to see what has been done in a commit without having to read the code. Also, commit messages make it easy to dive into git log and find that commit you want to review or revert.\r\n\r\n<cite>From [Git your act together](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/git-your-act-together/)</cite>\r\n\r\nBranches and pull requests\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nWe work using the master branch, branching out for any change and merging back to master using pull requests\r\n\r\n![branching and pull requests](http://content.screencast.com/users/jeppeliisberg/folders/Jing/media/e60b3b23-9943-44c7-ac9d-f11c831391c8/00000004.png \"Branching and pull requests\")\r\n\r\nHere's a few iron clad rules:\r\n\r\n* Master is ALWAYS deployable\r\n* NEVER commit directly to master - always push a change branch and issue a pull request\r\n* At least one other person should review and approve or comment\r\n* When at least two people (including comitter) has approved the request, anyone is allowed to merge into master\r\n* When a pull request is merged, the person who merged must delete the corresponding branch from github\r\n\r\nHere's a few rules of thumb:\r\n\r\n* Pull requests are cheap, don't be afraid to toss it away\r\n* Use pull requests to allow others to review and comment on ideas and experiements\r\n* Try to keep change branches and pull requests small and get them merged fast\r\n\r\n### Procedure when branching and merging\r\n\r\n    $ git checkout -b new_work_process\r\n    # make changes...\r\n    $ git add -p\r\n    $ git commit\r\n    $ git push origin new_work_process\r\n    Counting objects: 5, done.\r\n    Delta compression using up to 8 threads.\r\n    Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\r\n    Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 376 bytes, done.\r\n    Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)\r\n    To git@github.com:liisberg-consulting/fakta-backend\r\n     * [new branch]      new_work_process -> new_work_process\r\n\r\nNow go to github and issue a pull request:\r\n\r\n![github: new pull request](http://content.screencast.com/users/jeppeliisberg/folders/Jing/media/271aad08-1c4e-41f7-a9f7-3a9ac8266849/00000005.png)\r\n\r\n![github: create pull request](http://content.screencast.com/users/jeppeliisberg/folders/Jing/media/3120a995-7250-42d2-87bc-555b3e62bc14/00000006.png)\r\n\r\nTests and CI\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Philosophy\r\n\r\nTDB - something with how we like to think of tests and at what level(s) we like testing\r\n\r\n### Strategy\r\n\r\nTBD - guidelines to specific tests, including when to unit test, acceptance test etc (also, when NOT to test if ever)\r\n\r\n### Tools and libraries\r\n\r\nWe use rspec for rails/ruby tests and jasmine for JS/CS tests\r\n\r\nRun tests with:\r\n\r\n    bundle exec rake spec\r\n\r\n### CI\r\n\r\nAny commit or branch pushed to github will be checked out and built by the CI server. The CI server reports back to github, so the build status is visible for each commit.\r\n\r\nIf the branch being built is master, a successfull build will result in an automatic deploy to the production systems.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
